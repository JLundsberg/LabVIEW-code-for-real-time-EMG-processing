# LabVIEW-code-for-real-time-EMG-processing
Human-machine interfacing with EMG through LabVIEW. The code takes 8 channels of EMG data through COM ports, performs filtering, and displays the signals in real-time. Real-time frequency analysis is also done with point-by-point VIs. Control outputs can be setup using weighted RMS and threshold values, to output various computer keystrokes.
